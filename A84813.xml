         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I having Summoned the place before, re≈øolved upon Sunday night to Attempt it by Storm, which was agreed to be done in three places: The fir≈øt Po≈øt was on the We≈øt Gate by Colonel <hi>Hamond;</hi> on the North end of the Town by Lieut: Col: <hi>Pride;</hi> and on Tun≈øtall Church and Works by Col: <hi>Forte≈øcue.</hi> The time re≈øolved on, was in the Evening; our men fell on with great Re≈øolution (to whom Colonel

               <hi>Lamberts</hi> Regiment was a Re≈øerve, and to Alarm the Enemy el≈øewhere. Colonel <hi>Hamond</hi> entring the We≈øt Gate, where four Guns were planted, and two upon the Mill-Pool upon his Flank; The Enemy firing his great Guns but once, his men that had the Forlorn-Hope did very gallantly (as indeed they did all) and went freely on, and beat off the Enemy, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed one Fort after another; <hi>viz.</hi> Mount Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, the We≈øt Gate, Paradice Fort, and beat off the main Guard; where were taken four Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels: and ≈øo po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed the Town from the We≈øt Gate to little <hi>Dartmouth.</hi> In the Interim, Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Pride</hi> attempted the North part of the Town, called <hi>Harne≈øs,</hi> where beating off the Enemy he entred it, and took about Eighty Pri≈øoners in it, and by it po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed all the North part of the Town unto the Draw-bridge, which divided the North part from the re≈øt of the Town; where Colonel <hi>Hamonds</hi> men and his met Colonel <hi>Forte≈øcue</hi> with his men, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted Tun≈øtall Church, which was very well man'd with above One hundred men, and having in it ten Guns: His men, after ≈øome Di≈øpute, with good Re≈øolution entred the place and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed it, ≈øo that by this time the Enemy was beaten out of all, except the great Fort in the Ea≈øt ≈øide of the River, called King≈øworth Fort, and the Ca≈øtle with the Fort which lay over the Ca≈øtle at the mouth of the Harbor, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gallants Bower; to which la≈øt the Governour with the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> and as many as e≈øcaped us fled. After they were forced from their ≈øtrengths out of the Town, the Governor coming back from the Ca≈øtle to ≈øee in what po≈øture the Town was, had a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158991:3"/>remarkable ≈øhot; as he was in the Boat, one ≈øitting by him, a Musket ≈øhot was made at the Boat, which pierced the Boat, and through both the thighs of one that was next unto him, and about three inches into his own thigh, upon which he retreated to the Ca≈øtle. Our Dragoons, with two Companies of our Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, and ≈øome Seamen, were Ordered only to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm King≈øworth Fort, wherein was Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> with his Regiment, having in it twelve Guns, and twelve Barrels of Powder, and convenient propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ammunition. This was a very ≈øtrong Fort, with about four good Bulwarks, ≈øtrong enough to have made a trouble≈øome re≈øi≈øtance; but the Enemy came willingly to terms; and to ≈øave time, I willingly conde≈øcended to let Sir <hi>Henry Cary</hi> march away with the re≈øt, leaving the Arms, Ordnance, Ammunition, with all Provi≈øions in the Fort to me, and all engaging them≈øelves never to take up Arms more again≈øt the Parliament, which was accordingly performed. Next morning, being thus Ma≈øter of all but the Ca≈øtle, and Gallants Bower, I Summoned that, the Governor was willing to li≈øten unto me, but I held him to tho≈øe terms upon which after ≈øome di≈øpute he yielded, which was, to deliver him≈øelf, and all Officers and Souldiers upon Quarter: He ≈øent me out Colonel <hi>Seamor</hi> and Mr. <hi>Denham</hi> for Ho≈øtages, with whom came out the Earl of <hi>Newport,</hi> and all was this day performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. In this Fort and Ca≈øtle were Eleven Guns, with proportion of Ammunition and Provi≈øions.
